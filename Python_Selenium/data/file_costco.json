I would have given it a 5 star but the main negative I have found is the delay in focus when you zoom in on an object. At full zoom, you need either a tripod or a solid object to rest the camera on: but the power of the zoom at full 40X is amazing. I have used this for wildlife as well as landscape photography and I can get photos that otherwise would require using my full size Canon SLR, a large zoom lens and a tripod - not something I want weighing me down on long hikes in the mountains."}, {"title": "Good point and shoot camera with 4K vide", "author": "None", "date": "3 months ago  ", "body": "It is probably worth the price. The images and video are great quality and optical zoom is fantastic due to stabilization. However, there are some weak spots: stabilization only works when camera is pointing straight ahead, not upwards, the automatic picture mode does not deal with back light compensation and switching to manual exposure is cumbersome for point and shoot. So most pictures come out great, but some are not perfect. Also I noticed slight optical distortion of face in a portrait mode and at the edges of the view field."}, {"title": "Tough to focus, heavy, expensive", "author": "None", "date": "4 months ago  ", "body": "The good that if picture turns out sharp and light, it is a really good picture with good depth and colors, battery is good but I would not expect less from Canon. Zoom is amazing. And I am sure that there is a lot of other good characteristic being canon.\nThe bad and reason it is going back to Costco: - Screen tilts only one way so I can not take pictures over my head - do not see the screen - screen is not touch sensitive, so you are at the mercy of the camera to choose spot to focus on - camera is right less then half the time - no panoramic mode - big and heavy for point and shoot - button position is such that every time you try to get it out of the supplied case, setup button is pushed and settings are changed -! image stabilization does not work in the horizontal position (when taking shots up) - all the pictures of the ceiling or birds in the tree are blurry. In vertical position stabilization works great."}, {"title": "The good and the other.", "author": "None", "date": "a year ago  ", "body": "I was unhappy with some aspects of my recently purchased G7x Mark II and decided to buy this camera. I have taken several hundred images with it so far. There are some good things about it operationally that make it easier to use than the quirky, sometimes uncooperative G7x. Calling this lens \"superb\" is a stretch. I realize that big zooms involve trade offs so my findings are not that surprising I guess but I was hoping for better. Image quality shows less sharpness and lower contrast than the G7x by far. For internet images it's OK but for big prints it can't be that good. G7x Mark II when you can get it to behave makes super sharp images. You just can't win."}, {"title": "Sadly let down by the display screen.", "author": "None", "date": "a month ago  ", "body": "Photo and video quality have definitely been impressive... when I can see it.

I bought this as a replacement to the PS S90 -- now that was a simple point and shoot. This camera is a little bigger and heavier, and a lot more complicated. 4K video, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, 40X zoom, and more options in auto mode are to name a few. This will be my first point and shoot camera that will take a decent picture of the moon or nighttime activities, but it is taking a lot of studying. More flexibility comes at a price -- more upfront learning time. The camera comes with a 32Gb card and a carrying case. It does not come with a full manual and requires you to download the document. The carrying case only holds the camera which is not a plus. Additionally, it only comes with an AC charging unit (You must remove the battery from the camera to charge it). A USB cable with a Micro-B end will allow you to charge the battery within the camera. Canon sells additional batteries so that you can charge one out of the camera and one within. Anyone who spends time taking pictures away from charging units knows that you should carry a back up battery (this is where having a small pocket on the camera case would have been beneficial). I am happy with the quality of the pictures. Not so happy with the time it is taking to get set up."}, {"title": "40x optical zoom is really nice!", "author": "None", "date": "4 months ago  ", "body": "No view finder so impossible to see the screen with sunglasses on.

Really quite impressive. However ...\nThe control system is endlessly frustrating. I can get the thing into \"Food Mode\" with one click, but to turn the flash on or off requires 7 clicks of 3 different buttons and looking at the viewfinder. Indeed, there is very easy access to ridiculous features such as \"food mode\", \"sports mode\", and a mode that records short videos before a photo, but the user guide gives you very little specific information about what these modes do, and absolutely no control over how they function. Then, this camera is missing some modes found on other cameras that are actually useful, such as HDR or panorama.\nAnother frustrating feature is that metering and flash settings don't stay where you set them. If you set the metering to spot and happen to be in aperture or shutter priority mode, the metering changes when you go back to auto mode. Same with the flash settings of auto, full, or off. Moreover, even though you can set the camera to spot metering in several modes, it doesn't behave like most spot metering cameras where you depress the shutter button half-way to lock in a focus or exposure on the spot - no, it meters on the spot wherever the spot is, so you're out of luck if you want to properly expose something that is not in the exact center of the image.\nYet another endlessly annoying feature is the viewscreen (the only way of aiming the camera, btw). The viewscreen is always exposed - it cannot be turned so that it is protected from scratches. It is also on a single-axis hinge, which makes it only useful for \"selfies\".\nIn the end, the more I learned about this camera, the more frustrating it became. I'm going back to a Nikon or Panasonic/Lumix."}, {"title": "Some Unusual Features", "author": "None", "date": "9 months ago  ", "body": "One of the main reasons that I bought this camera was its Manual Focus feature. Unfortunately I have not yet figured-out how to effectively use the Manual Focus. With my limited experience with the camera, I usually give-up on Manual Focus and let the camera do the focusing.

Also this camera has the new Digic 8 sensor in it that makes a big difference.\nThis camera works well in low light but is not at it's best. Well lighted or sunlight conditions is where it excels. The \"Zoom\" on this camera is excellent and that is what I bought it for. A plus is the macro and movie modes.\nI wish a software update could be had for a multi frame focus (Face + Tracking) like the G7X MarkII. But that might be asking a bit much or I need to look further into the cameras adjustments for this. Right now I have it on the exact same focus adjustment as my Canon but I only get a single point focus and it is random on the screen.\nOverall this is a very good point and shoot camera.

Not acceptable even for that instant. Kind of ruins clean crisp focus otherwise. When changing zoom power always focus in the zoom mode AND shut off auto focus. I forgot to shut off auto focus a few times and have nice crisp zoomed in shots when videoing but then when zooming out, the auto focus chose something in the foreground and left my main subject soft again. Also I had to get used to a separate button to start videoing whereas my older Canon cameras used the same shutter button to start video. Missed a few video shots due to this. Shot 2 full 128 memory cards of video and am getting used to all this but it takes PRACTICE! Also, the camera does not reset to a \"normal\" mode. If you use the timer, it will stay on timer until you switch back. More practice. The one feature I really like is the \"oil paint\" mode. Makes everything almost surreal without external editing.

After about 2,000 pictures I dropped mine causing little damage and it continued to work another 4,000 pictures. Then early this year in Costa Rica (and another 1,000 + pictures) my 740 suddenly developed a problem: the view screen was only on the top half of the screen with white on the bottom half, the camera wouldn\u2019t take a picture, and when turned off the lens would only retract half way (and had to be pushed in with a snap). I figured it was finally resulting from the drop in VietNam. Between that trip and the next to South America I purchased another SX740 because I liked the small size and image quality with 40x optical zoom. My new 740 lasted about 2,000 pictures in Brazil when it developed the exact same symptoms. A few days later my wife\u2019s (after about 3,000 pictures overall \u2013 she doesn\u2019t take as many as I do) developed the EXACT SAME problem.\nAfter we got over the THREE FOR THREE anger she discovered while playing with hers that the problem only happened in \u2018Auto\u2019 mode. When in \u2018Food\u2019 or \u2018Sport\u2019 modes the cameras worked normally. We finished the trip using only those modes. Now, I\u2019m looking for some answers so I don\u2019t have to buy yet another two cameras (they won\u2019t be Canon SX740\u2019s next time) for our upcoming trip to Italy. ANY THOUGHTS???"}, {"title": "Geocaching and Hiking with my PowerShot", "author": "None", "date": "20 days ago  ", "body": "Purchased to replace my Canon Powershot G11 (that just up and died one day). Most of my photography is done while out hiking/Geocaching (landscapes/bugs/critters) out in the boonies.\nFirst time charging battery took hours, but needed charging early next day after testing/experimenting and getting used to the camera (my G11 battery only required charging about once a month). Second time, with one bar left, took 2 hours to charge. After a bit more use, I noticed that video DEVOURS the batteries energy in about -40 minutes with a full change. Taking snap shots has much more reasonable battery life.\nThe unit is feels solid with a good heft to it and it is small and should fit in most any pocket, but this one came with a case that goes on your belt loop. I prefer using the case but usually, when removing the camera from the case, I unwittingly press the wifi button. This does not really hurt anything but it is irritating.\nThe Flash Pop-up Switch, is ergonomically backwards. When holding the camera it falls near the index finger of the left hand, and it would be easy to \u201cpull\u201d the small lever towards you, but it actually needs to be \u201cpushed\u201d towards the front of the camera, which would be very awkward with your left hand index finger, causing you to \u201cregrip\u201d and use your thumb.\nThe battery/SD card cover needs to be unlatched/latched to open or close. A better design would be if the latch was defaulted to \u201clatched\u201d, meaning you would just need to close the lid and it would be secure, without the extra step of manually setting the latch.\nThe Screen folds 180 degrees, not nearly as versatile as my old G11 but does the job. I have fairly large hands. I found the topside controls quite easy to use, and like that the Mode dial is low profile, and has limited access preventing accidental movement (unlike my G11). I can\u2019t say the same for the Control Dial on the back. I find this quite awkward to use. My thumb is too fat requiring me to use my thumb nail, even then it\u2019s not easy. Further, the Screen gets in my way when needing to press on the left side of the dial.\nUnlike my G11, the Self-Timer is an on-screen function (vs. a dedicated button) that does not reset/default to off. After using the Self-Timer and shutting the camera off, when I next activated the unit it was still in Self-Timer mode, requiring multi steps to turn it off. Pain-in-the-butt. The camera comes with a 28-page Getting Started booklet, but it only covers very basic level operation. I highly recommend going online and downloading the Camera User Guide (not clear and easy to follow but much better than the Getting Started booklet).\nOverall, I like the camera, without being overly impressed. Photos quality is good, the zoom is amazing (use a tripod). I have to admit, this is the first time I got a decent photo of a full moon using auto settings from any camera of the many I have owned."}, {"title": "36 Ratings-Only Reviews", "author": "None", "date": "None", "body": "None"}]}}
