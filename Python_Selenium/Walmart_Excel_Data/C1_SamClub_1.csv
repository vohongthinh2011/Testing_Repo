1,The Sound Of Music (50th Anniversary Edition) (Widescreen),Walmart,CDA Lew,,10 days ago  ,"The 3830 has been a good replacement for my recently expired 4635. Its compact size is very similar, which I like, and it seems to print somewhat faster, which is also nice, even though not essential. I also appreciate the touchscreen controls, which make things easier and faster when making adjustments. The only negative for me is the lack of a paper tray; the vertical feeder won't hold nearly as much paper, and I'm not sure how it's going to handle 4x6 photo paper - time will tell. All in all, a smooth-working, dependable machine (my fourth from HP), so I'm happy.
