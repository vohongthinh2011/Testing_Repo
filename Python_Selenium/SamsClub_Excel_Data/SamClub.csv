1,"HP OfficeJet 3830 All-in-One Printer, Thermal Inkjet",SamsClub,Mel1818,Not a fan of the limited times you can print,8 days ago  ,"Just got this printer it works fine for now. But the problem I have with it is that you can get 15 page limit per month for free and if you want a higher limit you have to pay for it. Now why in the world do you have to pay for the amount of times you print? It's insane, as if buying paper and ink isn't enough to pay for. With other brand printers you can print as much as you want without having to pay for the amount of times you print. All you have to do is have a connection, paper and ink. So this subscription is stupid, oh also the fact that they track your printing is weird. I had no idea the subscription was something you were forced to do but I already set it up and stuff before I realized. But I'll test it out for a little while to see how it goes, won't buy again tho.",164,786,1 out of 5 stars.,2019-09-25 00:58:08.159769,https://www.samsclub.com/p/hp-officejet-38380-all-in-one-printer-thermal-inkjet/prod23121737

1,"HP OfficeJet 3830 All-in-One Printer, Thermal Inkjet",SamsClub,CDA Lew,Great printer at this price point!,10 days ago  ,"The 3830 has been a good replacement for my recently expired 4635. Its compact size is very similar, which I like, and it seems to print somewhat faster, which is also nice, even though not essential. I also appreciate the touchscreen controls, which make things easier and faster when making adjustments. The only negative for me is the lack of a paper tray; the vertical feeder won't hold nearly as much paper, and I'm not sure how it's going to handle 4x6 photo paper - time will tell. All in all, a smooth-working, dependable machine (my fourth from HP), so I'm happy.

1,"HP OfficeJet 3830 All-in-One Printer, Thermal Inkjet",SamsClub,Mel1818,Not a fan of the limited times you can print,8 days ago  ,"Just got this printer it works fine for now. But the problem I have with it is that you can get 15 page limit per month for free and if you want a higher limit you have to pay for it. Now why in the world do you have to pay for the amount of times you print? It's insane, as if buying paper and ink isn't enough to pay for. With other brand printers you can print as much as you want without having to pay for the amount of times you print. All you have to do is have a connection, paper and ink. So this subscription is stupid, oh also the fact that they track your printing is weird. I had no idea the subscription was something you were forced to do but I already set it up and stuff before I realized. But I'll test it out for a little while to see how it goes, won't buy again tho.",164,786,1 out of 5 stars.,2019-09-25 16:01:24.388870,https://www.samsclub.com/p/hp-officejet-38380-all-in-one-printer-thermal-inkjet/prod23121737

Its compact size is very similar, which I like, and it seems to print somewhat faster, which is also nice, even though not essential. I also appreciate the touchscreen controls, which make things easier and faster when making adjustments. The only negative for me is the lack of a paper tray; the vertical feeder won't hold nearly as much paper, and I'm not sure how it's going to handle 4x6 photo paper - time will tell. All in all, a smooth-working, dependable machine (my fourth from HP), so I'm happy.
